## 🚀 About Laiye ADP

ADP is Laiye's **intelligent agent document processing product (Agentic Document Processing, referred to as ADP)** , based on the general understanding ability of large models, without relying on rules and annotations, with the general understanding ability of multi-language, MultiModal Machine Learning, and multi-scene; autonomous planning and execution of intelligent agents, able to understand task goals, autonomous planning steps, invoke tools, and complete complex tasks; end-to-end business automation, from document input to business decision-making to human-machine collaboration, forming a complete closed loop.

**agentic-doc-parse-and-extract** is the official open-source CLI tool of ADP, supporting both manual terminal invocation and automatic invocation via AI Skill. With a single command, it can accomplish: structured document parsing + intelligent extraction of key fields, covering all scenarios including invoices, orders, certificates, bills, and general documents, outputting standard JSON, and seamlessly integrating with automation and AI workflows.

## 💡 Core Features

agentic-doc-parse-and-extract focuses on intelligent processing of the entire document workflow, taking into account both manual terminal calls and automatic calls by AI Agents. Its core functions cover all scenarios of parsing, extraction, and batch processing, requiring no complex configuration, and operations can be completed with a single command:

| Function Name | Function Description | Optimal Scenario |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **Document Parsing** | Automatically recognize multi-format documents such as PDFs and images, convert messy unstructured content (e.g., scanned documents, handwritten text, complex layout documents) into standardized Structured Data, while preserving the original document hierarchy and key relationships | Convert unstructured documents into Structured Data for LLM reading and subsequent extraction |
| **Out Of The Box Document Extraction** | Based on the native AI capabilities of the ADP large model, it comes with built-in standardized extraction models for invoices, receipts, orders, commonly used certificates in China, etc. No need to configure rules or manual annotation, one-click extraction of key fields from various types of general documentation, outputting standard JSON | Account Payable automation, expense management, procurement automation, quick entry of card and certificate information into the system |
| **Custom Document Extraction** | Supports independent creation, editing, and management of personalized extraction applications, allowing configuration of exclusive extraction fields and recognition logic for enterprise-specific documentation and industry-customized forms | Private extraction requirements for enterprise-specific documentation, industry-customized forms, and non-standardized documents |
| **Human-Review Collaboration** | Provides complete human-review collaboration APIs and CLI commands, supporting creation, editing, querying and deletion of review rules, AI-recommended rules, task execution (sync/async), and document result updates | Automated quality assurance, compliance review, human-in-the-loop document processing |
| **Webhook Callbacks** | Supports configuring Webhook callback URLs and trigger events, enabling real-time push notifications when task status changes, eliminating the need for continuous polling | Real-time task status monitoring, third-party system integration, event-driven workflows |

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Output JSON |
| `--quiet` | Quiet mode, output result only |
| `--lang <en\|zh>` | Interface language |
| `--app-id` | App ID (required for parse / extract) |
| `--async` | Async mode |
| `--no-wait` | Submit tasks only, do not wait for results (use with `--async`) |
| `--export <path>` | Export result to file (single file) or directory (batch) |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | Timeout (default 900s) |
| `--concurrency <n>` | Concurrent workers (free: max 1, paid: max 2) |
| `--retry <n>` | Retries for retryable errors (default 0) |
| `--file <path>` | Read task IDs from JSON file (output of `--no-wait`, query only) |

## Async Workflow

For large files or batch jobs, submit with `--async` and the CLI returns a `task-id`. Poll for results with `parse query` / `extract query`:

```bash
adp parse local ./big.pdf --app-id <app-id> --async
# returns a task-id

adp parse query <task-id>
```

### Two-Phase Async (`--no-wait`)

By default, `--async` submits and polls until completion — ideal for AI agents. For resumable workflows, use two-phase mode:

**Phase 1: Submit tasks**

```bash
adp extract local ./documents/ --app-id <app-id> --async --no-wait --export tasks.json
```

Output is a JSON array with task IDs:

```json
[
  {"path": "invoice.pdf", "task_id": "task_abc123"},
  {"path": "contract.pdf", "task_id": "task_def456"}
]
```

**Phase 2: Query results**

```bash
adp extract query --watch --file tasks.json
adp extract query --watch --file tasks.json --export ./results/
```

Even if the CLI crashes mid-way, task IDs in `tasks.json` are preserved — resume anytime with `query --file`.

## Human-Review Collaboration

Human-review commands manage collaboration rules and tasks for document quality assurance:

```bash
# Create a review rule
adp human-review rule-create --app-id <app-id> --rule-name "my-rule" \
  --rule '[{"rule_dimension":"整体文档","rule_setting":"所有字段不能为空"}]' \
  --rule-status "true" --rule-logic 2

# Update a review rule
adp human-review rule-update --app-id <app-id> --rule-name "my-rule" \
  --rule '[{"rule_dimension":"文档置信度","rule_setting":"不能小于0.9"}]' \
  --rule-status "false" --rule-logic 1

# Query rule config
adp human-review get-config --app-id <app-id>

# AI-generate rules
adp human-review rule-ai-generate --app-id <app-id> \
  --fields '[{"field_name":"amount","field_accuracy":"high"}]'

# Create async task
adp human-review task-create --app-id <app-id> --url https://example.com/file.pdf --async

# Query task status
adp human-review task-query <task-id> --watch

# Update document result
adp human-review result-update --file-task-id <task-id> \
  --collaboration-result '[{"field_name":"amount","field_type":"string","field_values":["100"]}]'
```

**Flags:**
- `--rule-status`: string (`"true"` / `"false"`, default: `"true"`) — use `=` to pass value (e.g. `--rule-status=false`)
- `--rule-logic`: integer — `1` = any condition, `2` = all conditions
- `--collaboration-result`: JSON — required fields: `field_name`, `field_type` (string/date/table), `field_values` (array). When `field_type=table`, use `table_values: [[{field_name, field_type (string/date only), field_values}]]`

## Batch Processing

When processing multiple files/URLs, the CLI writes each result to a separate file:

```
adp_results_20250417_153020/
├── _summary.json              # Summary (total, success, failed, per-file status)
├── invoice_01.pdf.json        # Successful result
├── contract_02.docx.json
└── report_03.pdf.error.json   # Error details
```

- `--export <dir>` — specify output directory
- Without `--export` — auto-creates `adp_results_<timestamp>/`
- Single file — outputs to stdout or the `--export` file path

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | All success |
| `1` | All failed / system error |
| `2` | Parameter error |
| `3` | Resource not found |
| `4` | Permission denied |
| `5` | Conflict |
| `6` | Partial failure (some tasks failed in batch) |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ADP_API_KEY` | API key (overrides config file) |
| `ADP_API_BASE_URL` | Service URL |
| `ADP_LANG` | Interface language (`en` / `zh`) |
| `ADP_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level (`debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error`) |
